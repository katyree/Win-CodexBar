//! When a CodexBar window may take keyboard focus.
//!
//! CodexBar is a tray utility. It takes the foreground only on a direct user
//! action: a tray click, a tray menu item, the global hotkey, or a click on a
//! control inside one of its own windows. Startup, a second instance handing
//! off to this one, refreshes, events and proof automation may show a
//! surface, but they must not move the foreground away from the app the user
//! is working in.
//!
//! `WebviewWindow::set_focus` is not a polite request on Windows. tao 0.34.8
//! (`src/platform_impl/windows/window.rs`, `Window::set_focus`, lines
//! 175-186) calls `force_window_active` (lines 1500-1527), which retries a
//! refused `SetForegroundWindow` after injecting a synthetic Alt press and
//! release through `SendInput` ("a little hack which can 'steal' the
//! foreground window permission"). That bypasses the foreground lock Windows
//! applies to background processes, and the injected Alt can open the menu
//! bar of the app the user is typing in. So `set_focus` is reserved for
//! [`Activation::UserAction`].
//!
//! Showing is kept apart from focusing: every CodexBar window is built with
//! `focused(false)` (`"focus": false` for `main` in `tauri.conf.json`), which
//! makes tao show it with `SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE` instead of `SW_SHOW` (tao
//! `window_state.rs`, `WindowFlags::apply_diff`, lines 325-337). [`apply`] is
//! the only place the focusing step happens.
